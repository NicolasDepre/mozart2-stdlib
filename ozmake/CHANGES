* version 0.73
** makefiles now support the 'contact' feature to specify MOGUL contact
   information:

       makefile(
         ...
         contact :
           o(
              mogul : 'mogul:/duchier/denys'
              name  : 'Denys Duchier'
              email : 'duchier@ps.uni-sb.de'
              www   : 'http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/'))

   the value on the contact feature can also be a list of records as shown
   above.  A makefile with contact info need not also actually provide anything
   else (like modules): instead, it can be used to automatically generate MOGUL
   entries (see below).
** ozmake --mogul=... now permits to manage the MOGUL entries associated with
   packages you provide.
*** ozmake --mogul=put
    creates all mogul entries associated with the package: this includes the
    package entry (if it provides any targets) and the contact entries (if
    any).
*** ozmake --mogul=db
    lists all your MOGUL entries made available to the MOGUL librarian for
    download.

* version 0.72
** ozmake --config=... now permits to manage predefined defaults
   defaults can always be explicitly overriden on the command line
   ozmake --config=set --FEAT1=VAL1 --FEAT2=VAL2 ...
     saves the given defaults for those features (ignoring features
     for which defaults cannot be set)
   ozmake --config=unset FEAT1 FEAT2 ...
     removes defaults for these features
   ozmake --config=list
     lists the current defaults
** option --exe controls the name and platform of installed executables
   the convention on Windows is that executables have an .exe extension
   while on Unix there is normally no extension.
   --exe=default only installs executables using the platform's convention
   --exe=yes only installs executables with .exe extension
   --exe=no only installs executables without extension
   --exe=both installs both
   --exe=multi installs both, but the .exe one is linked for Windows
   while the no extension one is linked for Unix
** additional features supported in makefile.oz
   requires   : [ ... ] for dependencies on other packages
   categories : [ ... ] for MOGUL classification
   version    : ... a version number e.g. "2" or "3.2.7"
** --freshen upgrades only if necessary, and does not report an
   error if it is not necessary to upgrade
** ozmake --extract will exceptionally write a makefile.oz if none
   was included in the package.  This is for compatibility with
   packages created with earlier versions of ozmake.

* version 0.71
** ozmake --extract: default directory changed from current directory
   to subdirectory with name derived from the package mogul id
** makefiles are now textually included in packages
   the preprocessed makefile is now called MAKEPKG.oz and is
   only used when installing from a package file when not explitly
   disabled by the user with --nousemakepkg

* version 0.7n
** start recording changes between versions
** OZLOAD properly passed to sub ozc processes
** fixed date handling: unfortunately, this is an incompatible change
   all recorded package dates prior to this fix, where incorrect

* previous history not recorded
